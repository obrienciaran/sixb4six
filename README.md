I live in Cork City in Ireland where there is an Asian street food chain of restaurants called 'Ramen'. Every day, Ramen have a deal called the 'Six Before Six', where a particular dish is â‚¬6 before 6p.m. 

The restaurant updates their website and Twitter daily with the dish on offer. My favourite dishes at this eatery are Pad Thai and Khao Pad. I found it annoying checking the restaurant's website or Twitter daily awaiting the day my favourite dishes are on offer. As well as this, I often forgetting to check the daily special.

With this in mind, I decided to create a script which scrapes their site, and sends me an e-mail and WhatsApp message with the special of the day. 

This python file was hosted on an EC2 instance on Amazon Web Services with a cron job scheduling the script to run once daily.
